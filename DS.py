# Data structures in Python

# Practicing sets

universal = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
first = {1, 4, 6, 3}
second = {2, 4, 8, 9, 5}


# Union
print(first | second)

# Intersection
print(first & second)

# Difference in a set
print(first - second)

# symetric Difference ina set
print(first ^ second)
